    <h1>BOLLYWOOD</h1>
    <P>Bollywood, Hindi-language sector of the Indian moviemaking industry that began in Bombay (now Mumbai) in the 1930s and developed into an enormous film empire.After early Indian experiments in silent film, in 1934 Bombay Talkies, launched by Himansu Rai, spearheaded the growth of Indian cinema. Over the years, several classic genres emerged from Bollywood: the historical epic, notably Mughal-e-Azam (1960); the curry western, such as Sholay (1975); the courtesan film, such as Pakeezah (1972), which highlights stunning cinematography and sensual dance choreography; and the mythological movie, represented by Jai Santoshi Maa (1975).

        Stars, rather than plots, were often the driving force behind the films. Beginning in 1936, when Ashok Kumar and Devika Rani emerged as the first major star pair, the Indian public developed an insatiable appetite for news about their screen heroes. This interest continued with male actors such as Raj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar, and Dev Anand in the 1950s and ’60s, Rajesh Khanna in the ’70s, Amitabh Bachchan in the ’80s, and Shah Rukh Khan in the ’90s. Popular female icons included Madhubala in the 1950s, Mumtaz in the ’60s, Zeenat Aman in the ’70s, Hema Malini in the ’80s, and Madhuri Dixit and Kajol in the ’90s.


        At the turn of the 21st century, the Indian film industry—of which Bollywood remained the largest component—was producing as many as 1,000 feature films annually in all of India’s major languages and in a variety of cities, and international audiences began to develop among South Asians in the United Kingdom and in the United States. Standard features of Bollywood films continued to be formulaic story lines, expertly choreographed fight scenes, spectacular song-and-dance routines, emotion-charged melodrama, and larger-than-life heroes

        <H5>Muhammed Rafi<BR>
            Indian singer</H5>
            <P>(born December 24, 1924, Kotla Sultan Singh, near Amritsar, Punjab, British India—died July 31, 1980), legendary playback singer who recorded more than 25,000 songs in a career spanning almost 40 years.

                Rafi studied music with eminent Hindustani singer Chhote Gulam Ali Khan. He eventually came under the tutelage of composer and musical director Feroz Nizami. A public performance that Rafi gave in Lahore when he was about 15 proved to be a turning point in his life. In the audience was Shyam Sunder, an acclaimed composer who was impressed with Rafi’s talent and invited him to Bombay (now Mumbai) to sing in films. Rafi recorded his first song in Lahore for the Punjabi film Gul Baloch (1944). In Bombay Rafi had his first physical role in Laila Majnu (1949). His earliest recordings in Hindi, also in Bombay, were for films such as Gaon ki gori (1945), Samaj ko badal dalo (1947), and Jugnu (1947). The composer Naushad recognized the budding singer’s potential and gave Rafi his first solo song assignment, “Tera khilona toota balak” in Anmol Ghadi (1946), and later the song “Is duniya mein ae dilwalo” in Dillagi (1949), which proved to be a milestone in his singing career.

                Rafi voiced songs for all the top stars of the day. His greatest gift was his ability to match his voice to the persona of the character played by the actor. Thus, he sounded the part for the romantic Dilip Kumar when he sang “Tere husn ki kya taarif karun” in Leader (1964), the soul of Guru Dutt in such songs as “Yeh duniya agar mil bhi jaaye to kya hai” in Pyaasa (1957), the irrepressible Shammi Kapoor singing “Yahoo” in Junglee (1961), and even the mischievous Johnny Walker offering a “Tel malish” (oil massage) in Pyaasa. His duets with other leading playback singers of Hindi cinema were equally memorable and popular.
                
                Rafi’s voice had a phenomenal range that composers explored to great advantage. His oeuvre included such classical songs as “Madhuban mein radhika nache re” in Kohinoor (1960) and “O duniya ke rakhwale” in Baiju Bawra (1952), such ghazals as “Suhani raat dhal chuki” in Dulari (1949) and “Chaudhavin ka chand” in the eponymous 1960 film, stirring patriotic songs including “Jahan daal daal par” in the 1965 film Sikandar-e-azam, and such light numbers as the rock-and-roll-inspired “Aaja aaja main hoon pyaar tera” in Teesri Manzil (1966). His last recording was “Tu kahin aas paas hai dost” for the 1981 film Aas paas. In 1965 Rafi was awarded the Padma Shri, one of the Indian government’s highest civilian honours.

                Alternate titles: Balraj Dutt
                Written and fact-checked by 
                Last Updated: Jan 16, 2023 • Article History
                Born: June 6, 1929 India
                Died: May 25, 2005 (aged 75) Mumbai India
                Sunil Dutt, original name Balraj Dutt, (born June 6, 1929, Khurd village, Jhelum district, British India [now in Pakistan]—died May 25, 2005, Mumbai), Indian actor, producer, director, social activist, and politician who was especially known for his several acting roles as a dacoit (member of an armed gang of bandits). While he continued to act until the time of his death, he assumed other offscreen roles in the film industry and also became involved in politics and with various social issues.
                
                After graduating from Jai Hind College, in Bombay (now Mumbai), Dutt took a job with a leading British advertising agency. His interest in the performing arts was stoked by his work as an announcer on Radio Ceylon’s Hindi service. There, as the host of a show, he met and interviewed a number of celebrities, including his future wife, the actress then known simply as Nargis.

                Dutt debuted in Hindi cinema with Railway Platform (1955), and his first major success came six movies later with Mother India (1957). His role in that movie was that of the outlaw hero Birju, and it remains one of Bollywood’s most-memorable performances of all time. Some of Dutt’s other successes at the box office were in Ek-hi-rasta (1956; “The Only Way”), Gumrah (1963; “Astray”), Waqt (1965; “Time”), Hamraaz (1967; “Confidant”), the comedy Padosan (1968; “Neighbour”), and Reshma aur Shera (1972; “Reshma and Shera”). Dutt acted in some 100 films, produced 7, and directed 6. He made his directorial debut in 1964 with the daring, experimental one-man film, Yaadein, later known as Memories.
                
                
                Also keenly interested in politics, Dutt became the sheriff of Mumbai in 1981. In 1984 he joined the Congress (I) party (so named for its descent from the Indian National Congress party and its leadership by Indira Gandhi) and was elected a member of parliament from northwest Mumbai for five terms (1984, 1989, 1991 [resigned in 1993 in protest over religious violence], 1999, and 2004). He worked actively for the cause of slum dwellers. In 2004 he was appointed India’s Minister for Youth Affairs and Sports, a post he held until his death.
                
                Dutt’s sociopolitical life was as active as his creative life. In 1981 he founded the Nargis Dutt Cancer Foundation in memory of his wife, who had succumbed to cancer that year. In 1987 Dutt led a 1,250-mile (2,000-km) peace march from Mumbai to the Golden Temple in Amritsar, to pray for peace when Sikh militancy was at its height in Punjab. In 1988, to appeal for global disarmament, he went to Japan and walked from Nagasaki to Hiroshima (both cities were targets of U.S. atomic bombs during World War II).
                
                Among Dutt’s many awards was the Padma Shri, which he received in 1968. He twice received the Filmfare Award (named for Filmfare magazine) for best actor: in 1964, for his work in Mujhe jeene do (1963; “Cry for Life”), and in 1966, for Khandan (1965; “Aristocratic Family”). His last film—apart from a brief appearance in a 2007 film—was Munnabhai M.B.B.S. (2003; meaning, roughly, “Gangster Munna, Married, with Children”). Dutt’s son, Sanjay, also became a Bollywood actor.

                <H1>Sachin Dev Burman<BR>
                    Indian composer</H1>
                    <P>Sachin Dev Burman, also called S.D. Burman, (born October 1, 1906, Comilla, British India [now in Bangladesh]—died October 31, 1975, Bombay [now Mumbai], Maharashtra, India), Indian music composer who combined a firm grounding in Indian classical music with a mastery of Bengali and northeastern folk music to produce a body of work that had a lasting impact on the Hindi film industry.

                        Burman’s father, Nabadwipchandra Dev Burman, played the sitar and was his first music teacher. He was later taught by North Indian classical musicians such as Badal Khan and Bhishmadev Chattopadhyay. Burman was educated at Comilla Victoria College (B.A., 1924) and the University of Calcutta (M.A.), in what is now Kolkata. Although he received a master’s degree in English literature, music was a passion he could not ignore.
                        
                        He began a career in radio and as a singer. His first recording as a vocalist was a composition by Bengal’s revolutionary poet-musician Kazi Nazrul Islam, and with it he started an association that would last several years. Burman worked as a music director in Calcutta until 1944, when he shifted to Bombay (now Mumbai). There he quickly established himself as an innovative film composer with an exceptional sensitivity to the demands of the moving image. His music enhanced the power of the visuals, as, for example, did the song “Yeh duniya agar mil bhi jaaye to kya hai” (Pyaasa), performed on-screen by Guru Dutt. Burman did most of his work for Dev Anand’s Navketan films (Taxi Driver, Funtoosh, Guide, Paying Guest, Jewel Thief, and Prem Pujari), Guru Dutt’s films (Baazi, Jaal, Kaagaz ke phool), and Bimal Roy’s productions (Devdas, Sujata, and Bandini).</P>
                        <H1>Yash Chopra<BR>
                            Punjabi filmmaker</H1>
                            <P>Yash Chopra, in full Yash Raj Chopra, (born September 27, 1932, Lahore, Punjab, British India [now in Pakistan]—died October 21, 2012, Mumbai, India), Punjabi filmmaker, who was known for his Bollywood films, especially romances such as Dilwale dulhania le jayenge (1995; “The Brave-Hearted [or Lover] Takes the Bride”) and action-packed thrillers such as Deewaar (1975; “Wall”). He is credited with opening the international market to Indian cinema.Chopra began his career as an assistant director to I.S. Johar (1920–84) and later worked with his elder brother B.R. Chopra (1914–2008). His directorial debut, Dhool ka phool (1959; “Flowers of the Dust”), a social drama that treated the birth of a child out of wedlock, was enormously popular. He followed it with Dharmputra (1961), a film adaptation of a novel about the pre-partition period of India’s history. His next effort, the popular Waqt (1965; “Time”), was India’s first film to feature several major actors, including Sunil Dutt, Raaj Kumar, Sadhana, and Shashi Kapoor, and it started a trend. Indeed, Chopra’s films provided a springboard for many actors—including Amitabh Bachchan (Deewaar and Trishul [1978; “Trident”]) and Shah Rukh Khan (Darr [1993; “Fear”])—who have since become legends in the Hindi film industry. Chopra released two films in 1969, Aadmi aur insaan (“Man and Humanity”) and the thriller Ittefaq (“Coincidence”). In the following year he launched his own production company, Yash Raj Films, which debuted with Daag (1973), based on English novelist Thomas Hardy’s 1886 novel The Mayor of Casterbridge.

                                In the 1980s a series of films by Chopra, including Silsila (1981; “The Affair”), Faasle (1985; “Distances”), and the action-oriented films Mashaal (1984; “Torch”) and Vijay (1988; “Victory,” a common male first name), flopped at the box office. His reputation was redeemed by Chandni (1989; “Moonlight”), but Lamhe (1991; “Moments”), which is considered by many critics to be his best film, did not achieve wide popularity. Among Chopra’s other noteworthy works as producer-director were Kabhi kabhie (1976; also called Kabhi Kabhie: Love Is Life), Kaala patthar (1979; “Black Stone”), Dil to pagal hai (1997; “The Heart Is Crazy”), and Veer–Zaara (2004), a romance between air force officer Veer Singh and Pakistani heiress Zaara Khan. Although he continued to be active as a producer, after 1991 he directed only five more films. </P>
