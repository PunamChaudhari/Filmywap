                Hindi cinema, popularly known as Bollywood and formerly as Bombay cinema,[4] refers to the film industry based in Mumbai, engaged in production of motion pictures in Hindi language. The popular term Bollywood, is a portmanteau of "Bombay" (former name of Mumbai) and "Hollywood". The industry is a part of the larger Indian cinema, which also includes South Indian cinema and other smaller film industries.[3][5][6]
                
                In 2017, Indian cinema produced 1,986 feature films, of which the largest number, 364 have been in Hindi.[3] As per data from 2014, Hindi cinema represented 43 percent of Indian net box-office revenue; Tamil and Telugu cinema represented 36 percent, and the remaining regional cinema constituted 21 percent.[7] Hindi cinema is one of the largest centres for film production in the world.[8][9][10] Hindi films sold an estimated 341 million and 316 million tickets in India in 2019 and 2018 respectively.[11][12] Earlier Hindi films tended to use vernacular Hindustani, mutually intelligible by speakers of either Hindi or Urdu, while modern Hindi productions increasingly incorporate elements of Hinglish.[13]
                
                The most popular commercial genre in Hindi cinema since the 1970s has been the masala film, which freely mixes different genres including action, comedy, romance, drama and melodrama along with musical numbers.[14][15] Masala films generally fall under the musical film genre, of which Indian cinema has been the largest producer since the 1960s when it exceeded the American film industry's total musical output after musical films declined in the West; the first Indian musical talkie was Alam Ara (1931), several years after the first Hollywood musical talkie The Jazz Singer (1927). Alongside commercial masala films, a distinctive genre of art films known as parallel cinema has also existed, presenting realistic content and avoidance of musical numbers. In more recent years, the distinction between commercial masala and parallel cinema has been gradually blurring, with an increasing number of mainstream films adopting the conventions which were once strictly associated with parallel cinema.
                
                The term Bollywood
                "Bollywood" is a portmanteau derived from Bombay (the former name of Mumbai) and "Hollywood", a shorthand reference for the American film industry which is based in Hollywood, California.[16]
                
                The term "Tollywood", for the Tollygunge-based cinema of West Bengal, predated "Bollywood".[17] It was used in a 1932 American Cinematographer article by Wilford E. Deming, an American engineer who helped produce the first Indian sound picture.[17]
                
                "Bollywood" was probably invented in Bombay-based film trade journals in the 1960s or 1970s, though the exact inventor varies by account.[18][19] Film journalist Bevinda Collaco claims she coined the term for the title of her column in Screen magazine.[20] Her column entitled "On the Bollywood Beat" covered studio news and celebrity gossip.[20] Other sources state that lyricist, filmmaker and scholar Amit Khanna was its creator.[21] It's unknown if it was derived from "Hollywood" through "Tollywood", or was inspired directly by "Hollywood".
                
                The term has been criticised by some film journalists and critics, who believe it implies that the industry is a poor cousin of Hollywood.[16][22]
                
                "Bollywood" has since inspired a long list of Hollywood-inspired nicknames.

            <p>Hollywood: Perhaps no other place on earth evokes the same air of show-business magic and glamour. The legend of Hollywood began in the early 20th century and is an earmark of modern American society rich in history and innovation.The 1900’s were a time of great advancement for film and motion picture technology. Exploration into editing, backdrops, and visual flow motivated aspiring filmmakers to push into new creative territory. One of the earliest and most famous movies created during this time was The Great Train Robbery, created in 1903 by Edwin S. Porter.

                Around 1905, “Nickelodeons”, or 5-cent movie theaters, began to offer an easy and inexpensive way for the public to watch movies. Nickelodeons helped the movie industry move into the 1920’s by increasing the public appeal of film and generate more money for filmmakers, alongside the widespread use of theaters to screen World War I propaganda.
                
                The end of World War I ushered the United States into a cultural boom, a new industry center was on the rise: Hollywood, the home of motion pictures in America.</p>

                If it’s your first time to hear about Tollywood and you’d like to know more about it, you’re in the right place. Today, we are going to give you more information on what Tollywood is.
                
                History of Tollywood
                The Tollywood or Telugu film industry originated in 1912 with silent films. The very first movie that was produced was Anusha Adusumalli in 1921, which was directed by Raghupathi Venkaiah together with his son R.S. Prakash. In 1936, the very first film studio in South India was built by Nidamarthi Surayya, and it was called Durga Cinetone. This studio is located in Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh. In 1935, Andhra Cine Tone was then created in Visakhapatnam by Jaganadha Raju. It is where he introduced digital theater sound in the film Jagadamba in 1935.Introduction and Popularity of the “Talkie”
                In 1931, the very first Tollywood film with audible dialogue was produced by H.M. Reddy, titled Bhakta Prahlada. He also directed the first bilingual talkie titled Kalidas in the same year, which was in Telugu and Tamil languages. Bhakta Prahlada was first released on September 15, 1931, and this date became the “Telugu Film Day,” commemorating its completion. The following year, the industry saw its first major commercial success with the film Lavakusa. With this, Tollywood films called talkies, which have sounds, quickly grew in number and popularity.
                
                By 1936, the mass appeal of film permitted directors to move away from mythological and religious themes. In that same year, a film called Prema Vijayam was released, which focused on social issues. Its success became the inspiration for other immensely positive social films. With this, Tollywood films from 1937 to 1947 focused on contemporary living.
                
                Tollywood During the Crown Rule
                In 1943, the occurrence of World war II and the succeeding resource scarcity triggered the British Raj to enforce a limit on the use of filmstrip to 11,000 feet. This was a sharp reduction from the 20,000 feet that had been common till then. With this, the number of films produced during the war was substantially lower than in previous years. But before that, an important shift happened in the industry.
